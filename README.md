Turn based Android game
Hi, my name is Nick Stoltzfus. I am a GT student and a scholar of Chinese.
My current goal is to produce a game along these rules:

Objective:
Destroy the enemy base or kill five of the enemies’s Units within an MxN square.
Health is displayed as a cute little circle in the upper left of each Unit.

Rules:
Each Base can only build one Unit per turn. Each unit can only attack once each turn.
Squares are Bases.
Bases are Units
Figures are Units.
You must select a Unit before you can make any actions from that Unit.
Each player can select 2 Units per turn (with an additional +1 select when a player reaches 6 units and another +1 select for every 2 additional Units).

How to Play:
Click once on a base or a Unit to select it (didn’t have time to show Select status on a Base, I got used to it).
Once selected, dragging from that unit to any empty square up, down, left or right will move it to that square.
Each unit has a set distance that it can move per turn.
Dragging from that Unit to another unit in a line(up, down, left, or right) will attack in that direction.
Dragging from your base to an empty square will build a new Unit.
Toggle the Unit you wish to build with the button at the top of the screen.
When you are done with your turn, select the End Turn button at the top of the Screen.
